Neo Studio
----------------------

This is program aims to be a modding tool for Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2.
As of yet, Neo Studio can only edit general character parameters. The ground work is set however, and once I'm able to resume my work on this program, adding melee, ki blast and movement parameters will be very easy.


--Usage--

Neo Studio uses character files in the .pak format.
If you don't own these files, there are AFL files in the corresponding folder. Use these with AFS Explorer and their respective AFS file to extract the .pak files.


--Requirements--

To build the application, you need:

- Qt5 (5.15)
- CMake 2.8.11 (or higher)


--Build Instructions (Linux)--

Go into the project directory and type

cmake ./
make

after this is finished, you should have a Neo Studio executable.


--Build Instructions (Windows)--

Idk how CMake works on Windows lmao you gotta find that one out on your own

--Credits--

As of right now, I (jagger1407) am the sole contributor of this program.
